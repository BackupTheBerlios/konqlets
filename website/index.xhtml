    <h1>Konqlets - Konqueror Bookmarklets</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
	The goal of this project is to enable Konqueror to run <a
	  href="http://www.bookmarklets.com/">Bookmarklets</a>
	in both a user-friendly and secure way. We will clearly identify what
	security issues there are through in-depth
	analysis of the latest in competing browsers' 
	<a
	  href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Asecurityfocus.com%20javascript">Security
	  Problems</a>. Furthermore,
	we will stretch and test KJS, DCOP, KIO, and Konqueror Plugins to their
	limits to meet our goals. Doing so will
	help strengthen the KDE project with feedback not only from end-users,
	but also from end-developers who utilize the provided
	APIs to extend its applications.
      </p>
      <p>
	Because the accessibility is better, this project will rely on <a
	  href="http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/">
	  Jesse's Bookmarklets</a> for test cases. These test cases will be our
	standard benchmark for the project's progress--even if that means
	providing patches for components outside of this project's scope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bookmarklets have been discussed on the KDE bug tracker before, for historical 
        information and guidance, please consult the following:

        The following paragraphs give a quick overview about what this project
        will try to achieve.  The diagram to the right will assist as you read
        these quick blurbs. Hopefully, the text here is coherent and applicable
        in a meaningful and implementable way.
      </p>

      <p>
        To begin, in a very obvious way, the user will store their bookmarklets
        in the Personal Bookmarks folder--which is displayable in the main
        Konqueror window--and will click on the script there.  This clicking
        action will invoke a KIO Slave built to receive data for the JavaScript
        protocol.  This protocol will be a kin to the data protocol KIO slave
        where the protocol configuration is set to receive Raw data.  The
        JavaScript protocol utilizes the Raw data as an executable script,
        prior to which it will perform some cleanup and prechecks.  
      </p>

      <p>
        In order for the script to execute on the webpage the User is looking
        at, the Slave needs to instruct Konqueror to go back one step in its
        History.  At this point, either the slave or the plugin needs to do
        cleanup of the History.  If it is at all possible to instruct the 
        protocol not to put the current action in History, that would be more
        optimal and potentially more secure.  These instructions to Konqueror
        will be done via DCOP. The Konqueror instance will be identified by
        using findObject().
      </p>

      <p>
        Before actually executing the JavaScript, there are several checks that
        need to be made. These are:
        <ul>
          <li>See if the current instance allows JavaScript execution.</li>
          <li>See if the user has answered whether to execute Bookmarklets before.</li>
          <li>[Optional] Pre-parse the JavaScript checking for no-no's.</li>
        </ul>
        If any of these results in a negative, execution will immediately stop
        and currently will appear to be a no-op to the user.  An infobox may be
        appropriate .. but won't be an immediate need.
      </p>

        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is merely an example dialog box, it will probably change. The 
        purpose of the box will also allow the user to give permission to 
        Konqlets to "remember" what they would like to do in the future if
        another Bookmarklet is encountered. It's possible to add a menu item
        to the Tools > Konqlets menu of Konqueror such that this setting can
        be changed via the Plugin.
